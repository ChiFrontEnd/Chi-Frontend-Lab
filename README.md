# 🚦 Glassmorphism Traffic Light

A modern, animated **traffic light simulation** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project combines **glassmorphism design**, glowing LED effects, ambient background animations, and interactive controls to create a realistic yet futuristic traffic light experience.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🎨 **Glassmorphism UI** with frosted glass, bevels, and glossy highlights
- 💡 **Realistic LED Lamps** (Red, Yellow, Green) with glow and active states
- 🌌 **Ambient Background Animation** for a digital, futuristic feel
- 🔩 **Decorative Screws & Industrial Flair**
- 📱 **Responsive Design** for mobile and desktop
- ⚙️ **Interactive Controls**:
  - Manual buttons to activate **Red, Yellow, Green**
  - **Auto Mode** cycles through lights automatically (Red → Green → Yellow)
  - Auto indicator with pulsing dot animation

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – semantic structure
- **CSS3** – gradients, blur effects, animations, glassmorphism styling
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – event handling, lamp activation, auto cycling logic

---

## ⚙️ JavaScript Logic Overview
The interactivity is powered by `script.js`:

- **Lamp Activation (`setActive`)**
  - Removes `active` class from all lamps
  - Adds `active` class to the selected lamp (Red, Yellow, Green)

- **Manual Controls**
  - Buttons allow direct activation of each lamp
  - Cancels auto cycle when manually selected

- **Auto Cycle (`cycle`)**
  - Cycles through Red → Green → Yellow with realistic delays:
    - Red → 2.5s  
    - Green → 3.2s  
    - Yellow → 1.6s  
  - Updates automatically using `setInterval`

- **Auto Mode Button**
  - Starts continuous cycling
  - Displays **Auto Indicator** with pulsing green dot
